Dolo is a tool to describe and solve economic models. It provides a simple classification scheme to describe many types of models, allows to write the models as simple text files and compiles these files into efficient Julia objects/functions/methods representing them. It also provides many reference solution algorithms to find the solution of these models under rational expectations.

Dolo understand several types of nonlinear models with occasionnally binding constraints (with or without exogenous discrete shocks), as well as local pertubations models.

More docs coming soon...
