Evaluate the Jacobian for the `f!` function of model `m`. `n` is the number
of equations in `f!`. `before` is a tuple of arguments to `f!` that come before
the argument to be differentiated. `to_diff` is a tuple of the arguments that
might be differentiated, `after` is a tuple of arguments that come after the one
to be differentiated, and `i` specifies which element of `to_diff` should be
differentiated. Thus, `f!` is called like this:

```julia
f!(out, m, before..., to_diff[1:i-1]..., to_diff[i] ,to_diff[i+1:end]...,
   after...)
```

```julia

```

Compute certain Jacobians of the function `f!` for model `m`. `n` is the number
of equations in `f!`. `before` is a tuple of arguments before those to be
differentiated, `to_diff` is a tuple of arguments to differentiated, `after`
is all arguments that come in `f!` after the arguments for the derivatives.

The output is a vector containing `length(to_diff)` `Matrix{Float64}` elements.
